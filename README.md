# Blip & Blop for the browser

The original Blip'n Blop PC game (Loaded Studio), compiled to WebAssembly with
Emscripten so it runs in a browser and looks the same as the original, pixel
for pixel.

- `game/` holds the original C++ source and data, imported from
  [benkaraban/blip-blop](https://github.com/benkaraban/blip-blop)
  (`vc-projects/Blip_n_Blop_3`). Browser-only changes sit behind
  `#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__` so the native build is unchanged.
- `web/` holds the browser shell, the data loader and the build script.

## Build

```sh
source /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
web/build.sh            # output in web/dist/
python3 -m http.server -d web/dist 8000
```

`ffmpeg` is needed at build time: two music tracks (`gameover.zik`, `tambour.zik`)
are MP3 files, and the browser mixer only decodes OGG, so the build re-encodes them.
